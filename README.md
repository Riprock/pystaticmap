Mapping out python files function calls

This project is meant to help with some static python analysis
The problem I have encountered from time to time is wanting to just know at a basic level some of the structure of a python file
I just want to know where the function calls go and what their names are
so I am attempting to make this as a way of being able to better understand python files when looking at a new code base
Also for my own debugging realizeing where I have function calls

One application is helping with obfuscated or convoluded python code. That way right out the gate there is a construction of what is going on in the code
